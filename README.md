# eve-fit-display
A nearly standalone (EVE Online) fit display script for inclusion in arbitrary websites.
(Does require jQuery to be loaded before this script.)

With the impending removal of the in game browser, ship fittings will have to be viewable out of game (unless you plan to make all your visitors log in and send fits via CREST).

This script can be loaded in an arbitrary HTML document to generate viewable, copy-pasteable fit windows for any element that it detects as a fit.
